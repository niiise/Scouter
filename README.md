This project was done in fulfillment of capstone project requirements for my MS in Business Analytics at Northwood University (MGT 683).

This project uses LaihoE's demoparser tool (found at https://github.com/LaihoE/demoparser) to parse and compile Counter-Strike 2 player statistics from CS2 .dem files. Files were obtained through FACEIT's API, and are replays from season 51 of their advanced division in the region North America.
