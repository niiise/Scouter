Scouter seeks to assemble a database of individual player statistics for the scouting and analytics purposes of the amateur North American Counter-Strike scene. <br/>

Statistics collected include: <br/>
Traditional scoreboard statistics (kills, deaths, damage, etc.) <br/>
Opening statistics (opening kills, opening deaths, opening kill round win conversions, traded opening deaths) <br/>
Multikill statistics (multikills, multikill round win conversions) <br/>
Pistol statistics (pistol kills, deaths, hs%) <br/>
Clutch statistics (clutch wins) <br/>
Trade statistics (KAST, trade kills, traded deaths) <br/>


Files were obtained through FACEIT's API, and are replays from season 51 of their advanced division in the region of North America.  <br/>
This project makes use of LaihoE's demoparser tool (found at https://github.com/LaihoE/demoparser) to parse and compile Counter-Strike 2 player statistics from CS2 .dem files.  <br/>
This project was done in fulfillment of capstone project requirements for my MS in Business Analytics at Northwood University (MGT 683). <br/>


Future plans: <br/>
More detailed clutch statistics (attempts, save rate, etc.) <br/>
More detailed utility statistics (number of nades thrown total, util to kill conversion rate) <br/>
Accuracy statistics (hs per bullet shot, smoke spam kills) <br/>
Positional statistics (determining player roles and therefore target statistics for each role) <br/>
Stratification of ratings per map <br/>
